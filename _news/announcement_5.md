I had a great time attending EAMS (e-Assessment in Mathematical Sciences) 2018 in Newcastle -- thanks to the organisers for putting on such a great meeting. e-assessment is something I'm interested in exploring in the near-future and so this meeting was a fantastic way to find out about the different tools being used by teams around the country, and some further afield. I may end up writing up a blog post about e-assessment at some point in the future, particularly if anybody indicates that they're interested, but for the time being I don't believe I have much to report, hence the news item rather than a blog post.

e-assessment and electronic delivery of teaching materials in general also allows for really interesting possibilities (as well as their own problems) in supporting those with additional learning requirements. With this in mind, I took part in a short group project looking at how the popular (open-source) e-assessment tools might work with assistive technologies such as screen-readers, particularly focussing on how screen-readers could interact with graphs -- this remains a topic that could be worked on in future.
