We've entered a new teaching term at Durham -- namely Michaelmas 2018 -- and this means the majority of my time will now be taken up with planning and teaching. This term I'm teaching and helping to plan the Introduction to Programming Course, acting as a computing demonstrator for Statistics I and running a [project on Moonshine][proj] for final year students. I will also be doing some e-assessment related work this term and next, so I expect posts (when I get time to write them) will focus on sharing resources and discussing e-assessment. There may be an actual maths related post here eventually :persevere:.
