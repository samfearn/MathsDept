It's been a little quiet around here recently -- I blame a busy term. I've been spending quite a lot of time working on implementing e-assessment in our first year programming course using a [Moodle] plug-in called [Coderunner], and considering how best to implement e-assessment in other first year mathematics courses. I expect to write about both the programming and mathematics systems at some point in the future.

I'm currently writing a talk for tomorrow based on my [two] [posts] about setting up this website with Jekyll. While doing some reading and finding themes to recommend, I found out about a javascript framework called [reveal.js] for creating web based presentations. I currently write most of my presentations in [Beamer] and I think reveal.js is capable of providing all the features I tend to use in a presentation. Particularly since [there exists][katexplug] a KaTeX plugin for reveal.js to allow me to use $$\LaTeX{}$$ -- I think MathJax is also an alternative if I need a $$\LaTeX{}$$ feature not privded by KaTeX. I don't have time to investigate this any further now, so I'm making a note of it here for later.
