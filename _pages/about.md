I'm an Associate Professor (Teaching) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University and a member of the Education and Pedagogy group. My primary focus is on formative assessment in higher mathematics, and in particular on the role computer-aided assessment can play in this. 

Before accepting this position, I worked in the Durham maths department as a Teaching Fellow. I studied for my Ph.D. at Durham under the supervision of [Anne Taormina] and completed this in 2018 with a thesis entitled 'Supersymmetric Sigma Models And Their Indices'.

My main mathematical interests are in string and conformal field theory, 2d superconformal algebras and their representations as well as Moonshine and related topics.

Aside from mathematics, I'm interested in computing and technology, gaming and climbing.
